        Sample Site believes in the union of customer satisfaction and remaining faithful to the fundamentals of time honoured best practice. We will work with YOU to give you everything you want from your tattoo. We believe ourselves to be approachable, friendly and passionate about what we do and understand that getting your first or even your 100th tattoo can be a daunting experience. We'll ensure your 100% happy that you came to see us.

        We work on both an appointment and walk in basis. Should you require an appointment we use a deposit system that will be deducted from the overall price of the finished tattoo. We also believe in keeping the traditions of the street shop alive and strive to keep walk ins available most days. If we cannot fit you on the same day we will endeavor to fit you in within a week of your enquiry, depending on the art work that needs to be prepared for your tattoo.

        Of course it goes without saying that we use only the highest quality equipment, all needles and ink receptacles are single use and we use vacuum autoclave sterilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't forget you MUST be 18 to get a tattoo, with no exceptions. If we suspect you may be under 18, proof of ID will be required in the form of a current Passport or driving license.

        We look forward to meeting you.
